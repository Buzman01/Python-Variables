# Python-Variables
//Variables in python generally not required to mention the data type before the variable name.  Variable is a named representation of a memory location.  In simple, the system selects one location in memory for your value to be stored
we will see the declaration of variables in the python.

//Ex:

#following line stores an integer in x variable
x=8
print(x) #output is 8
We can do multiple declarations of integer values is as follows

x=10
y=20
print(x,y) # output is 10 20

#Another way of writing the same

x,y=10,20 # Here, x is 10 and y is 20
print(x,y) # output is 10 20
Floating point values can be stored in variables, follow the same syntax as integers.

//Ex:

x=3.142
print(x) #prints 3.142 as output
We can assign a string value to a variable

//Ex:

x='buzz.com is a programming website'
print(x) 
# Above line prints the buzz.com is a programming website as an output
We can also assign a Boolean value to the variable

//Ex:

#Boolean values must be True or False
x=True
print(x)
# the above line prints the True as an output
One important point is, in True or False, T and F are capital letters. That is, you must always right True (T is capital letter) or False (F is capital letter).
